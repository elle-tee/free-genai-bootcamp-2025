## Functional Requirements

The Spanish Learning Language School (SLLS) wants to enhance and extend their language learning experience to current and attract prospective students.

The school has secured funding to support this effort and wants to build the infrastructure in-house and on premises. SLLS believes it will help to control and manage costs, and better secure student data. 

The school currently has a total enrollment of 100 students and has allocated $10K USD towards equipment purchase.

## Assumptions

We assume the acquired hardware will be capable of handling the open source models and workloads given to it. We also presume the school's existing network is able to support the internet traffic and adequately serve at least 100 students.

## Data Strategy

We will make our best attempt to utilize free materials. When deemed necessary, purchases may be made at the school management's discretion. Data will be stored in local database(s).

## Considerations

IBM Granite will be considered since it is open-source, allowing clear insight into the model and providing traceable training data.
